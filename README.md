# MemeMe 2.0
The app enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share that meme on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email.
In this project, sent memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

MemeMe 2.0 covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app.
It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience.
